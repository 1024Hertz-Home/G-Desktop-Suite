# Google Drive Electron

Ever wish you didn't have to go to [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com), click the blue button, and log in every single time you wanted to create a new document? Do you miss the good old days of not paying $99/year for Microsoft Office 365 and wish you could use Google Drive like the Microsoft Office Suite? Well you're in luck!
